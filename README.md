Placeholder for a way to analyze journal entries, which I store in a private repo called 'papertrail', using [Cohere's API](https://txt.cohere.com/rag-quickstart-connectors/).

Plan:
- Work through tutorial using GitHub as a connector
- Have a conversation with my past self about a person ("What past things about xyz could have led up to xyz's latest development")
